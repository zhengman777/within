Bug fixes:

	1) Tools.makeText() will now accept any parameter which can be converted to
		a string using str().
		
	2) The collision QuadTree has been reworked to test each collision only once,
		doubling performance and erasing accidental, redundant calls of Object.event_collision().

Code-breakers:
	
	1) event_keyDown and event_keyUp changed to event_keyPressed and event_keyReleased, respectively.
	
New behaviour:
	
	1) Sprites now flip over the axes drawn through their center.
	
	2) Obj.setVisible() and Obj.setSolid() now apply to objects which have already been added to a room.

New features:

	1) A Sprite's animation can be paused with Sprite.setFrameTime(0).
		Note: A Sprite with 1 image will have FrameTime = 0 by default.
	
	2) Use Sprite.setAlpha(<0-255>) to set the alpha for all images of a sprite.
	
	3) Use Sprite.setAlphaKey(color) to set the colorkey for all images of a sprite.
	
	4) Use Sprite.loadAlphaMasks to add per-pixel alpha to images from a mask.
		Note: This is slow. Avoid it by saving images with built-in per-pixel alpha.
	
	5) Use Object.setDepth(int) to set the rendering depth of an Object
		Note: Objects with a small depth will be drawn over Objects with a large depth.
	
Bug fixes:

	1) Collision detection now works properly with auto-generated bounding boxes.
